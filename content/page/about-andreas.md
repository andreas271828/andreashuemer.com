At some point in your life you ask yourself what is it that you want to
contribute to this world. What legacy do you want to leave?

Now, at the time that I am starting this blog, I am in my mid thirties. I have
travelled dozens of countries on six continents; I have lived in Europe and
Australia; I have friends and family all over the world; I have enjoyed a very
high level of education; and I have had a very successful career and some minor
successes in sports.

I have concerns as well as bright visions about the future of humanity.

I am about to start a family and I want to support my child as much as I can to
prepare it for a global life with many challenges and opportunities. I want to
raise a child that is happy and successful. And success can come in many
different shapes.

I'm inviting you to join me on my journey. Learn from my accomplishments as well
as from my failures, my joy and my despair. Share your own experiences and ask
for advice. Become part of a network of parents who collaborate to raise a
generation of happy children that lead us into a bright future.
